  description: The fang of a predatory beast is an object endowed with a special
    and dangerous force of nature, and when combined with other artifacts, it can
    serve as a useful talisman.
  lore: "I think figuring out where to get them isn't very difficult \u2014 you just
    need to hunt down a predator. But if you don't want to anger the spirits of the
    forest, perhaps you'll be lucky enough to find the fangs of a deceased beast
    or to exchange them with someone."

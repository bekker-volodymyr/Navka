  description: The fang of a predatory beast is an object endowed with a special
    and dangerous force of nature, and when combined with other artifacts, it can
    serve as a useful talisman.
  lore: I think guessing where to get them isn't too hard - you need to hunt a predator.
    But this may anger the gods. Be careful.

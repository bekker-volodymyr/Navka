  description: The flesh of a living being is a very good source of nourishment,
    both for humans and for spirits, like yourself. You just don't need to prepare
    it.
  lore: Obtaining a piece of meat is very easy - you just need to kill some living
    creature. I advise nourishing yourself with Parubkas - they are the easiest to
    hunt, and their death is unlikely to anger the gods and spirits of nature.

  _name: Mavka
  description: 'Sure, you''re not the only mavka in this forest! There are many girls
    like you, and all of you are destined to protect the spirit world. If you meet
    other mavkas, you can give them something, and maybe they will thank you in return. '
  befriending: NONE
  lore: From behind the trunk of an old, split willow, half-withered, emerges a Mavka
    in bright green clothing, with loose black hair that has a green sheen. She spreads
    her arms and runs her hand over her eyes.

  _name: Witch
  description: Living on the border between the human world and the world of spirits,
    witches possess secret knowledge that enables them to prophesy and cast spells.
    Perhaps she will share her knowledge with you, but she is unlikely to do so for
    free.
  befriending: NONE
  lore: When she gets younger, she'll put on a white blouse and let her braids loose
    like a girl, and she'll go milk the cows, sheep, goats, mares, dogs, cats around
    the village, and through the swamps, she'll milk frogs, lizards, and snakes.

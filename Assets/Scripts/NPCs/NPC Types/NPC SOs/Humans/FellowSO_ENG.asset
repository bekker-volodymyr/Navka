  _name: Fellow
  description: These foolish youngsters, upon sighting a wood nymph, dash headlong
    to the village to their own to tell of their find, then they'll come after you,
    believing that once caught, you'll do their bidding. Their weakness lies in their
    susceptibility to the allure possessed by every wood mavka.
  befriending: NONE
  lore: Some rested in the taverns, some in the straw after such a thrashing, while
    others headed to the fields to scare the girls.

  _name: Bear
  description: These huge fluffballs can hardly resist the sight of honey and fish.
  befriending: This beast, though it appears formidable, will never attack people
    on its own, and it is generally quite friendly towards forest spirits like you.
    However, it is best not to provoke it, as it can become a serious opponent.
  lore: NONE

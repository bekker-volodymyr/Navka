  _name: Wolf
  description: 'Wolves hunt in forests and fields in packs. There is real strength
    in a pack. They are hostile towards people but neutral towards forest spirits,
    as long as you do not threaten their pack. If a wolf becomes your friend, it
    will protect you and your home well. '
  befriending: 'Like their descendants, the dogs, these creatures are not very picky
    about friends. It''s enough to feed them meat, and they will stay with you until
    the end. Once you befriend them, don''t forget to continue feeding the wolf with
    the same meat, or it will get offended. '

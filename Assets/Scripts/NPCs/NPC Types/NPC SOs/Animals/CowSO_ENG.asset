  _name: Cow
  description: These are very sweet and kind animals. You can find them in villages
    among people. People value them for the milk they produce. If they don't provide
    milk, they are used for their meat.
  befriending: ' Taming a cow is unlikely for you since people have already done
    it first. However, you can still ask it for milk without any trouble.'
